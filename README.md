# TicTacToe
This is an implementation of the game TicTacToe that supports 1 and 2 player gameplay. 

The game tracks scores of pairs of players over a session, and reports the running total of the current pair at the end of each game. 

The purpose of this project was to write a version of the minimax algorithm without outside assitance.
